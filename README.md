# Recommendation System

## Introduction

This is a recommendation system that recommends books (only in French) to users based on their liked books.

## Usage

Clone the repository of the system you would like to use:
- [book recommendation system with shell](https://github.com/mducos/recommandation_system/tree/main/ShellScript)

And follow the instructions on the README file

## Releases

May 31, 2024: First version of the book recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
June 2, 2024: When a saga is included in the list of beloved books, only the next volume not on the list can be recommended. For example, if a volume 3 is present in the list of beloved books, volume 2 cannot be recommended.

## What's next?

Some ideas for future improvements and contributions: 
- recommend as a priority volumes 1
- adapt the recommendation system for films
- create a visual interface with the Django framework
- improve the recommendation algorithm
